      <h3>After-School Math Help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tutoring sessions ran by math teachers at NPA.</li>
        <li>A casual drop-in environment to get help on homework, study, etc.</li>
        <li>One hour sessions available 3 times per week.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Teacher Office Hours</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Math teachers offer help once or twice a day during ILS ("Integrated Learning Strategies," which is like a study hall).</li>
        <li>If a student's ILS teacher is unable to help with a math problem, they can go to another classroom for help.</li>
        <li>Students may use this to get last-minute questions answered while studying for a quiz or test.</li>
        <li>A great way to get help from NPA math teachers when after-school help conflict's with a student's shcedule.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Peer Tutoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Students get help from another NPA student who has succeeded in the course in a previous year.</li>
        <li>Can help students get a different perspective on topics, beyond what is presented by their teacher.</li>
        <li>Ran by the counseling department.</li>
        <li>Example: An 11th grader may help a 9th grader with Geometry homework.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Daily Zoom Sessions by AmeriCorps</h3>
      <p>Students can get online help from a tutor every day of the week, including limited hours on weekends. These sessions are ran by AmeriCorps 
        in partnership with the University of Arizona. For more information, please visit <a href="https://crr.math.arizona.edu/tutors">their 
          official page.</a></p>
      <h3>Online Resources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most teachers post due dates and other important info about their course on Google Classroom.</li>
        <li>Students are given a "Join Code" at the start of the school year to access these resources.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">KhanAcademy.org</a> is a website with helpful math tutorial videos.</li>
