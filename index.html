      <h2>Resources (All 100% Free)</h2>
      <h3>After-School Math Help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tutoring sessions ran by math teachers at NPA.</li>
        <li>A casual drop-in environment to get help on homework, study, etc.</li>
        <li>One hour sessions available 3 times per week.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Teacher Office Hours</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Math teachers offer help once or twice a day during ILS ("Integrated Learning Strategies," a type of study hall).</li>
        <li>If a student's ILS teacher is unable to help with a math problem, they can go to another classroom for help.</li>
        <li>Students may use this to get last-minute questions answered while studying for a quiz or test.</li>
        <li>A great way to get help from NPA math teachers when after-school help conflicts with a student's schedule.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Peer Tutoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Students get help from another NPA student who has succeeded in the course in a previous year.</li>
        <li>Can help students get a different perspective on topics, beyond what is presented by their teacher.</li>
        <li>Ran by the counseling department.</li>
        <li>Example: An 11th grader may help a 9th grader with Geometry homework.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Daily Zoom Sessions by AmeriCorps</h3>
      <p>Students can get online help from a tutor every day of the week, including limited hours on weekends. These sessions are ran by AmeriCorps 
        in partnership with the University of Arizona. For more information, please visit <a href="https://crr.math.arizona.edu/tutors">their 
          official page.</a></p>
      <h3>Online Resources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><img src="googlecr.png" alt="Google Classroom Logo" style="width: 5%;">Most teachers post due dates and other important info about their course on Google Classroom.</li>
        <li>Students are given a "Join Code" at the start of the school year to access these resources.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">KhanAcademy.org</a> is a website with helpful math tutorial videos.</li>

      <h2>F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Is my child automatically tested for placement to be initially placed on the Advanced Progression?</b>
          <i>Students are initially tested based on parent referral.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>What does the Accelerated Progression entail?</b>
          <i>Students will take courses in 6th and 7th grade that cover 6th, 7th, and 8th grade standards to be on track to take Algebra 1 
            in 8th grade.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>What happens if my child is NOT tested but IS advanced?</b>
          <i>Starting at the beginning of the year all students will be using an online program called IXL that does an initial diagnostic 
            test to check their current level of understanding. Teachers will make adjustments based on these results.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>Will I have access to resources from the curriculum to assist my child at home?</b>
          <i>Yes! Open up,  Illustrative Mathematics, and MathMedic have a parent portal where parents can access the content. Most 
            teachers also post their notes and other resources online. Google Classroom can be accessed by parents and guardians.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>Why did you pick these curricula for your courses?</b>
          <i>We chose these curricula for their standards alignment, focus on problem-based learning, and emphasis on reasoning, discussion, 
            and deep conceptual understanding.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>What’s the difference between Advance Placement (AP) and Dual Enrollment (DE)?</b>
          <i>Both allow a student to earn college credit for a course. If the course is DE, the student earns college credit through Coconino 
            Community College associated with their grade in the teacher’s gradebook. If the course is AP, the student earns college credit 
            if they perform well on a single assessment, typically given in May. AP credit is accepted at all colleges/universities in the U.S. 
            Transfer credit from CCC is accepted at all in-state universities, but might not be accepted at all schools (such as private 
            out-of-state colleges).</i> </li>
