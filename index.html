      <h2>Resources (All 100% Free)</h2>
      <h3>After-School Math Help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Tutoring sessions run by math teachers at NPA.</li>
        <li>A casual drop-in environment to get help on homework, study, etc.</li>
        <li>One hour sessions available 3 times per week.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Teacher Office Hours</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Math teachers offer help once or twice a day during ILS ("Integrated Learning Strategies," a type of study hall).</li>
        <li>If a student's ILS teacher is unable to help with a math problem, they can go to another classroom for help.</li>
        <li>Students may use this to get last-minute questions answered while studying for a quiz or test.</li>
        <li>A great way to get help from NPA math teachers when after-school help conflicts with a student's schedule.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Peer Tutoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Students get help from another NPA student who has succeeded in the course in a previous year.</li>
        <li>Can help students get a different perspective on topics, beyond what is presented by their teacher.</li>
        <li>Example: An 11th grader may help a 9th grader with Geometry homework.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Daily Zoom Sessions by AmeriCorps</h3>
      <p>Students can get online help from a tutor every day of the week, including limited hours on weekends. These sessions are run by AmeriCorps 
        in partnership with the University of Arizona. For more information, please visit <a href="https://crr.math.arizona.edu/tutors">their

      <h2>F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Is my child automatically tested for placement to be initially placed on the Advanced Progression?</b>
          <i>Students are initially tested based on parent referral. Testing will be during the summer on an opt-in basis.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>What does the Accelerated Progression entail?</b>
          <i>Students will take courses in 6th and 7th grade that cover 6th, 7th, and 8th grade standards to be on track to take Algebra 1 
            in 8th grade.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>What if my child is struggling in the Advanced Progression?</b>
          <i>Students are constantly evaluated while in the accelerated program.  If the teachers feel like the student is struggling too 
            much and getting overwhelmed, we will start discussions with families and counselors to determine if they should be moved back 
            to the standard progression.</i>
        <li> <b>Will I have access to resources from the curriculum to assist my child at home?</b>
          <i>Yes! Open up,  Illustrative Mathematics, and MathMedic have a parent portal where parents can access the content. Most 
            teachers also post their notes and other resources online. Google Classroom can be accessed by parents and guardians.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>Why did you pick these curricula for your courses?</b>
          <i>We chose these curricula for their standards alignment, focus on problem-based learning, and emphasis on reasoning, discussion, 
            and deep conceptual understanding.</i> </li>
        <li> <b>What’s the difference between Advanced Placement (AP) and Dual Enrollment (DE)?</b>
          <i>Both options offer college credit. Dual Enrollment (DE) awards credit through Coconino Community College based on the course 
            grade. AP credit depends on a single May exam and is accepted as transfer credit by a larger number of schools, while CCC 
            credits transfer to Arizona universities but may not transfer to some out-of-state or private schools.</i> </li>
